## Update

April was an exciting month! We launched Cascade STEAM, [Community Groups](Groups/index.md), [Community Projects](Projects/index.md), and [Mentorship](Mentorship.md).

We also collaborated with [LinuxFest Northwest](https://lfnw.org) to organize and host the [LinuxFest Northwest 2025 Event](https://lfnw.org/schedule/). It was a blast! See the [LinuxFest Northwest 2025 YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjDc7gDlIASRAcG0cxWYOnNGwFnykUMNZ) for recordings of the fest as they become available.

New in May is the launch of the Cascade STEAM [Cyber](Cyber.md) and [Engineering](Engineering.md) [Community Groups](Engineering.md)! Closing at the end of May is registration for the [Summer Mentorship Program Cohort](Mentorship.md), which will begin in June with registered participants.
