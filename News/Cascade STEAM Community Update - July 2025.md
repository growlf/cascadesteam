## **Update**

In June we kicked off the [Summer Mentorship Program Cohort](https://cascadesteam.org/mentorship), hosted community group events, prepared for PNW Climate Week, and continued development of our Internship Program.

July includes further summer program development (below), preparation for PNW Climate Week, and brainstorming and planning for our upcoming Hackathon Event spearheaded by the Engineering Community Group. In August we'll take a break from Community Group events to fully enjoy summer and instead host the Cascade STEAM Summer Social. Community Group activity will restart in September.

Wishing you all a safe, sunny, and fabulous July!
