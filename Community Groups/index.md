Cascade STEAM Community Groups convene aspiring, current, and retired professionals interested in a STEAM topic to connect with fellow community members, discuss technical topics, participate in community building and community service programs, and collaborate with organizations in shared purpose on community projects.

## Current Community Groups

Community Groups are made possible through the commitment of [volunteer organizers](Leadership.md) and open collaboration of [Partners](Partners.md). Scheduled events can be found on the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/cascadesteam) and discussion at the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub (Discord)](http://hub.cascadesteam.org).

Community Groups include:
- **[Citizen Science](Citizen%20Science.md)**: science, in particular life sciences
- **[Cyber](Cyber.md)**: cybersecurity
- **[Data Engineering](Data%20Engineering.md)**: data engineering, including data storage and access, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs)
- **[Engineering](Engineering.md)**: engineering, including robotics
