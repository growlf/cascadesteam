Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a Cascade STEAM [Community Group](https://cascadesteam.org/community-groups) focused on AI learning and AI-related community projects. We host live sessions (in-person and virtual) with speakers across industries and time zones, share real experiments and use cases, and create space for honest questions and thoughtful discussion. 

**What you’ll get:**

* Live sessions (in person \+ virtual) with speakers across industries  
* Real use cases and experiments (less hype, more “what actually works”)  
* Space to ask blunt questions and share your experience  
* A community that cares about humans as much as technology

## Meetings

We plan to meet on the fourth Thursday of the month from **5:30–7:30pm** at [The Bellingham Makerspace](https://bellinghammakerspace.org/). Meeting details will be posted on the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub (Discord)](http://hub.cascadesteam.org) and the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam/). Cascade STEAM uses the Community Hub and Meetup to coordinate and share events.

Additional events and workshops will take place with hybrid events or in-person hackathons. Have a suggestion? [Lets chat\!](mailto:artificial-intelligence@cascadesteam.org)
