# Cascade STEAM Data Engineering

Data Engineering is a Cascade STEAM [Community Group](Community%20Groups/index.md) with a focus on data engineering topics, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLM), and welcoming participation in [community projects](Community%20Projects/index.md) from a data engineering perspective.

## Meetings

We plan to meet \~monthly on varying days and locations. Meeting details will be available on the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org), and the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam).
