# Mentorship

Cascade STEAM Mentorship connects community members interested in STEAM in either a "Traditional Mentorship" or "Peer Mentorship" arrangement and provides a support structure for a positive mentorship experience for all.

"Traditional Mentorship" pairs a junior and senior member based on personal and professional interests to help the junior member (mentee) establish and progress goals while the senior member provides personal and professional guidance (mentor).

"Peer Mentorship" pairs either junior or senior members together to create a peer relationship as they work on self improvement topics together. Goals are separately established by each peer based on their own interests, and mentorship occurs via the collaboration, accountability, and encouragement of Peer Mentorship partners.

For Summer 2025, Mentorship is designed for those 18 years of age or older - high school students, college students, professionals, and retired professionals. Stay tuned for the expansion of mentorship for those younger than 18 years of age. 

## How It Works

- You must be 18 years of age by June 5, 2025 to register.
- Submit your registration to participate as a Mentee, Mentor, or Peer Mentor Partner by May 31, 2025.
- Mentorship Program Organizers will match participants based on interests.
- Mentorship Pairs are introduced on June 5, 2025.
- A mentorship handbook will be provided to help provide a positive mentorship experience for all, which provides recommendations for those new to mentorship.
- Participants meet with their mentorship partner ~twice per month for ~one hour in each month of the quarter.
- Group discussion occurs on the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org) (Discord). Private conversation occurs in any format of interest to all parties - in person, phone, online, etc.
- While organized mentorship activities for this cohort end after a three month period, we encourage participants to stay connected.

## Community Groups

Mentorship is integrated into [Community Groups](Community%20Groups/index.md), each convening separately in recurring meetings to discuss topical interests and connect with fellow community members. See all scheduled Community Group events at the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/cascadesteam).
