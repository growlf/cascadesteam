Program dates in November 2025 are **November 15, 22, and 29 from 1pm-4pm** located at the [Bellingham Makerspace](https://bellinghammakerspace.org) in the [Bellis Fair Mall](https://bellisfair.com).

Services include:

* Computer hardware and software troubleshooting
* Computer privacy and security assessment, recommendations, and configuration
* Computer operating system updates and installation

Is your computer no longer supported by the original manufacturer? This is a HUGE privacy and security risk\! We can help install a new, secure, and FREE Linux operating system to give a new life to your computer.
