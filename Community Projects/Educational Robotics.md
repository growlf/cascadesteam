# Educational Robotics

Educational Robotics is a collaboration of the Cascade STEAM [Engineering Community Group](https://cascadesteam.org/engineering) and [Bellingham Public Schools](https://www.bellinghamschools.org) to support their [VEX Robotics Program](https://www.vexrobotics.com/). With VEX Robotics, hundreds of students throughout the district participate in a range of casual to globally-competitive robotics development, including mechanical engineering, fabrication, assembly, software development, technical writing, and project management. We help students learn robotics and host local robotics events.

## Volunteers

Volunteers are needed\! Be a mentor volunteer to help students in learning robotics and/or an event volunteer to help us host robotics events. 

**Mentor Volunteers** contribute their robotics-related experience to assist students during arranged after-school periods \- commonly on Wednesdays from 3:30pm-5:30pm.

**Event Volunteers** support the execution of major robotics events. No experience is necessary for some roles. Engineering and technical experience is always a plus\! Roles include: Check-in, Robot Inspecting, Competition Scoring, Team Queuing, Field Resetting, and Judging. Please see the [BPS VEX Robotics 2025 Volunteers Needed](/docs/BPS VEX Robotics 2025 Volunteers Needed.pdf) document for more details.

Events in Whatcom County during the 2025-2026 school year are:

* Cross-Border Challenge on Saturday December 13th  
* Bellingham Robo Bash on Saturday January 17th

Join the Cascade STEAM [Engineering Community Group](https://cascadesteam.org/engineering) each month to help coordinate efforts and engage with fellow community group members. Scheduled events are arranged via the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/cascadesteam).

Note: All those interested to volunteer must complete the [Bellingham Public Schools Volunteer Application](https://www.bellinghamschools.org/get-involved/volunteer).

## Sponsors

Sponsors are needed\! The cost of competition is expensive \- particularly transportation costs for those students reaching the highest level of competition. Please see the BPS VEX Robotics 2025 Sponsor Letter for more details.
