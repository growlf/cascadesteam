# Service Corps

Cascade STEAM [Service Corps](https://cascadesteam.org/service-corps) is a technology training program for social good. Each quarter, student interns and volunteers work closely with technology professionals to help develop and maintain the systems that we utilize for our organization and community programs, including [Digital Navigators](https://cascadesteam.org/digital-navigators) and [HelpDesk](https://cascadesteam.org/helpdesk).

Internship includes an arranged number of hours and collaboration with education partners for program credit (currently unpaid). Volunteers participate as available.

For both Interns and volunteers, Service Corps includes:

* Mentorship with business and technology professionals  
* Computer networking fundamentals  
* Open source software fundamentals  
* Server management  
* Network management  
* Database management  
* Issue Tracker management  
* Project management  
* Customer Service through [Digital Navigators](https://cascadesteam.org/digital-navigators), [HelpDesk](https://cascadesteam.org/helpdesk), and other programs

Collaboration occurs virtually on the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org) and on Tuesday and Saturday evenings in person at the Bellingham Makerspace.

To apply: Please email your resume and cover letter detailing your experience, community interests, and career aspirations with the subject “Service Corps Application”. You must be at least 18 years old at the beginning of the quarter in which you participate.

We are now accepting intern and volunteer applications for Winter, Spring, and Summer 2026\.
