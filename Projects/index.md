Cascade STEAM Community Projects are organized collaborative efforts for community impact and social good. We welcome all people of all ages to participate. Organization and discussion occurs at our [Community Group](Groups/index.md) meetings and on our [Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org). See our [Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/cascadesteam) for scheduled events.

## Digital Navigators

FREE Community Tech Support is now available from Cascade STEAM via our [Digital Navigators](https://cascadesteam.org/digital-navigators) Program. Assistance is offered to the public from technology students and industry professionals through scheduled onsite events at social welfare and support organizations to help resolve basic computing challenges completely free of charge.

## Educational Robotics

[Educational Robotics](Educational%20Robotics.md) is a collaboration of the Cascade STEAM [Engineering Community Group](https://cascadesteam.org/engineering) and [Bellingham Public Schools](https://www.bellinghamschools.org) to support their [VEX Robotics Program](https://www.vexrobotics.com/). With VEX Robotics, hundreds of students throughout the district participate in a range of casual to globally-competitive robotics development, including mechanical engineering, fabrication, assembly, software development, technical writing, and project management. We help students learn robotics and host local robotics events.
