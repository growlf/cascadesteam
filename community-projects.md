# Community Projects

Cascade STEAM Community Projects are organized collaborative efforts to provide strategic support from the STEAM community for community impact and social good. We collaborate with fellow nonprofit organizations working on community impact programs to provide strategic support and community engagement and we welcome all people of all ages to participate. Organization and discussion occurs at our [Community Group](/community-groups) meetings and on our [Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org). See our [Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/cascadesteam) for scheduled events. See below for details of current Community Projects.

## HelpDesk

Community Tech Support is now available from Cascade STEAM via our **HelpDesk Program**. Assistance is offered to the public from technology students and industry professionals by donation. Services include: Computer Hardware and Software Troubleshooting, Computer Privacy and Security Assessment, Recommendations, and Configuration, and Computer Operating System Updates and Installation. Please refer to the [Cascade STEAM HelpDesk Page](/helpdesk) for program details.

## Mentorship

**Mentorship** connects community members interested in STEAM in either a “Traditional Mentorship” or “Peer Mentorship” arrangement and provides a support structure for a positive mentorship experience for all. “Traditional Mentorship” pairs a junior and senior member based on personal and professional interests to help the junior member (mentee) establish and progress goals while the senior member provides personal and professional guidance (mentor). “Peer Mentorship” pairs either junior or senior members together to create a peer relationship as they work on self improvement topics together. Goals are separately established by each peer based on their own interests, and mentorship occurs via the collaboration, accountability, and encouragement of Peer Mentorship partners. Please refer to the [Cascade STEAM Mentorship Program Page](/mentorship) for program details.

## Stormwater Monitoring

Join the Citizen Science Community Group as we continue our organizing and support of [RE Sources](https://re-sources.org) and their [Stormwater Monitoring Project](https://www.re-sources.org/2024/06/three-years-of-bellingham-stormwater-monitoring-reveals-pollution-hotspots-including-taylor-dock/) to help protect Bellingham Bay. Organizers are working to create science, technology, and administrative projects and subprojects for community members to easily plug into and contribute as we work together as a team to resolve challenges.
