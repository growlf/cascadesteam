# Cascade STEAM Cyber

Welcome to Cascade STEAM’s Cyber-focused community group! We are just getting started as a community group and we’d love to have you join us at an upcoming meeting. Meetings are free and all are welcome. Anyone with an interest in cybersecurity is welcome and encouraged to attend. Please help us by spreading the word to friends and colleagues.

## Meetings October - November 2025

We meet on the second Thursday of the Month from ~5:30-7:00pm at various locations. Meeting details will be available on this page, the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org), and the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam).  We will not hold meetings in August or December; join us for Cascade STEAM Socials on these months instead!


Join us as we continue to work on organizing our group and building a local cybersecurity community. Our meetings are free and anyone with an interest in Cybersecurity is welcome to attend.

Mark your calendars and watch this space as we confirm meeting locations. Consider creating a [Meetup account](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam) and following Cascade STEAM, to receive email notices about our events.
