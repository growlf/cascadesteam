# Open Source

Join us each third Wednesday of the Month as we meet to discuss Open Source Software and Hardware. We helped relaunch the Bellingham Linux Users Group earlier this year after it succumbed to the chaos of COVID, and we have reformatted as Cascade STEAM Open Source as we acknowledge the shift from Linux-focused topics to the vastness of Open Source Software and Hardware. Our first several months will feature a new HomeLab Series, as we highlight fundamental open source software and share how we are incorporating these solutions into our own organization and programs.

## Meetings

We plan to meet Monthly every third Wednesday of the month from 5:30pm – 7:30pm at the Bellingham Makerspace. Meeting details will be available on this page, the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org/), and the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam).
